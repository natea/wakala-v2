### **Wakala & Kasipulse Integration: Initial Strategy & PRD**

* **Project:** Wakala OS Pilot \- Kasipulse Integration  
* **Date:** June 6, 2025  
* **Author:** Kris Mondlane (via Gemini Assistant)  
* **Status:** Version 1.0 \- Draft for Review

### **Part 1: Initial Strategy Document**

#### **1\. Overview & Vision**

This document outlines the strategy and requirements for the pilot integration of **Kasipulse** (`Kasipulse.store` and `Kasipulse.run`) as the first flagship tenant on the Wakala Operating System.

The vision is to create a seamless, end-to-end, WhatsApp-native experience that allows Kasipulse's vendors to easily list products and customers to purchase them, with integrated payments and hyper-local delivery. This pilot will serve as the foundational proof-of-concept for the Wakala OS model, demonstrating our ability to empower local entrepreneurs by solving their core technology challenges.

#### **2\. Strategic Goals**

The primary objectives for this pilot are:

1. **Validate the Wakala OS Model:** Prove that our multi-tenant orchestration engine can successfully power a third-party's business operations via WhatsApp.  
2. **Solve the "Uncle Charles" Problem:** Demonstrate tangible value by creating an AI-powered conversational onboarding flow that makes it radically simple for non-tech-savvy vendors to list products.  
3. **Test Core Platform Pillars:** Implement and test our shared **Payments** and **KYC** service layers in a real-world transactional environment.  
4. **Create a Reusable E-commerce Template:** Develop a set of conversational flows and integrations that can be templatized and rapidly deployed for future e-commerce tenants on the Wakala platform.

#### **3\. Key Partners & Roles**

* **Wakala (Platform & Integrator):**  
  * Provides the core Wakala OS, including the AI orchestration engine and WhatsApp integration.  
  * Develops the conversational user flows (the "apps") for vendor onboarding, customer purchasing, and driver dispatch.  
  * Integrates and manages the shared Payment Gateway and KYC provider services.  
* **Kasipulse (Lionel \- Technical Partner):**  
  * Provides and maintains the backend logic, databases, and APIs for `Kasipulse.store` (product/order management) and `Kasipulse.run` (delivery/driver management).  
  * Acts as the primary technical liaison for the API integration.  
* **Kasipulse (Joanie \- Business & Community Partner):**  
  * Provides deep domain expertise and validates the user experience.  
  * Recruits and manages the pilot group of vendors, customers, and drivers in Mitchells Plain.  
  * Leads on-the-ground user testing and feedback collection.

### **Part 2: Product Requirements Document (PRD)**

#### **1\. Introduction & Problem Statement**

**Problem:** Township entrepreneurs in communities like Mitchells Plain face significant barriers to participating in the digital economy. Existing e-commerce platforms like Shopify are too expensive and technically complex for aspiring sellers who may lack digital literacy. This results in lost economic opportunity and keeps local commerce offline and inefficient.

**Solution:** This project will create a suite of WhatsApp-based "apps" on the Wakala OS that allows Kasipulse vendors to manage their online stores and customers to buy from them through simple, guided conversations, with logistics handled by a local driver network.

#### **2\. Personas**

* **"Uncle Charles" \- The Aspiring Vendor:**  
  * A pensioner with deep community ties and valuable products/skills (e.g., gardening).  
  * Owns a smartphone and uses WhatsApp but is not tech-savvy. Is intimidated by terms like "banner" or "product description."  
  * **Goal:** To sell his products to a wider audience without needing to learn how to use a computer or complex software.  
* **Brenda \- The Local Buyer:**  
  * A resident of Mitchells Plain who is comfortable with WhatsApp and online payments.  
  * She wants to support local businesses but values the convenience of e-commerce.  
  * **Goal:** To easily discover and purchase products from local sellers and receive them quickly.  
* **David \- The Delivery Driver:**  
  * A local resident with a vehicle, looking for flexible work.  
  * He needs a simple way to receive and accept delivery jobs and get paid reliably. He does not want to use a complex, data-heavy mobile app.  
  * **Goal:** To get a steady stream of delivery requests on WhatsApp and manage his work and payments easily.

#### **3\. Core User Journeys (Epics)**

1. **Epic 1: Vendor Onboarding & Product Listing:** The end-to-end process for a seller like Uncle Charles to set up their store and list their first product.  
2. **Epic 2: Customer Discovery & Purchase:** The end-to-end process for a buyer like Brenda to find a product, pay for it, and receive confirmation.  
3. **Epic 3: Order Fulfillment & Delivery:** The workflow that connects the vendor, driver, and customer after a purchase is made.

#### **4\. User Stories & Conversational Flow "Receipts"**
