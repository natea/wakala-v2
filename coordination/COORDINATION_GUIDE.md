# Multi-Agent Development Coordination Guide

## Overview

This guide outlines how to coordinate autonomous or semi-autonomous agents working collaboratively on a shared project.

## Coordination Protocol

### 1. Task Assignment

* Check `orchestration/agent_assignments.md` before starting
* Claim your task by logging your agent ID
* Avoid overlap through transparent ownership

### 2. Knowledge Sharing

* Log all useful discoveries in `memory_bank/`
* Include failed attempts to reduce redundancy
* Share tuning parameters and workarounds promptly

### 3. Progress Updates

* Record progress in `orchestration/progress_tracker.md`
* Mark completed subtasks inside `subtasks/` files
* Note blockers or required inputs from other agents

### 4. Integration Points

* Follow `orchestration/integration_plan.md` for assembly
* Test partial integrations regularly
* Log interface contracts and assumptions

## Communication Standards

### Status Markers

* ðŸŸ¢ COMPLETE â€“ Task finished and verified
* ðŸŸ¡ IN\_PROGRESS â€“ Actively being worked on
* ðŸ”´ BLOCKED â€“ Dependent or paused
* âšª TODO â€“ Unclaimed or unstarted
* ðŸ”µ REVIEW â€“ Awaiting validation

### Update Format

```markdown
## [Timestamp] Agent: [Agent_ID]  
**Task**: [Brief summary]  
**Status**: [Status marker]  
**Details**: [Progress, issues, discoveries]  
**Next**: [Planned follow-up action]  
```

## Critical Rules

1. **No Uncoordinated Edits** â€“ Avoid editing shared files without claiming
2. **Always Test Before Completion** â€“ Validate outputs before status updates
3. **Log All Failures** â€“ Negative results are part of the process
4. **Share Tunings and Fixes** â€“ Parameters, configs, and tricks belong in memory\_bank
5. **Commit in Small Units** â€“ Make atomic, reversible changes
